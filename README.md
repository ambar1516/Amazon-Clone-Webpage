Project Title: Amazon Clone (Frontend Project)

Project Description:

This is one of my personal projects where I have invested significant effort to replicate the frontend design and functionality of the Amazon website using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Although the project currently focuses only on the frontend, I plan to continue developing it by implementing backend functionality and database integration in the future to make it more realistic and fully functional.

Key Features:

Homepage: A faithful recreation of Amazon's homepage with featured products, rotating banners, and current deals.

Product Listing: Displays products with images, titles, prices, and customer ratings, simulating real-world product showcases.

Cart Functionality: Users can add and remove items from their shopping cart dynamically on the client side.

User Authentication: A basic simulated login and registration system (frontend-only at this stage).

Sidebar Navigation: A collapsible sidebar menu for category-based browsing.

Arrow-based Scrolling: Left and right arrow buttons to navigate through product carousels.

Back to Top Button: Enables users to quickly scroll back to the top.

Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop screens with responsive design techniques.

Why Amazon Clone?

I chose to build an Amazon clone because Amazon represents a complex and fully-featured e-commerce platform. It allowed me to challenge myself with real-world frontend development problems such as layout design, user interaction, dynamic components, and responsive behavior. Through this project, I improved my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gained deeper knowledge of DOM manipulation and interactive UI design.

Since this is only the frontend part right now, I plan to add backend functionalities such as database integration, real user authentication, and dynamic product management in the future to make the clone even more realistic and feature-complete.

Technologies Used:

HTML5 – For semantic page structure.

CSS3 – For styling, layout, and responsive design.

CSS Animations – To enhance the visual experience.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – For interactivity, event handling, and DOM manipulation.
